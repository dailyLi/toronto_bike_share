    <h2>Notes: Data cleaning & processing methods</h2>
        
    <li>Remove entries where Trip Duration = 0. These might be some errors or technical issues when the bikes were released.</li>
        
    <li>Convert start and end time into date format for easier extraction and calculation</li>
        
    <li>Calculate distance and average speed for each trip: not a very precise calcluation as the distance was not straightline between two points, and users were not constantly cycling, but we can still use it as a reference. In this calculation we excluded the round trips (same start and end station)</li>
